# Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository records all my machine learning practices and projects at Brandeis University.
The `Regression.Rmd`, `Classification.Rmd`, and `Clustering.Rmd` are the codes for the Diabetes Diagnosis Machine Learning Project.

### Main task finished on this project:
* Extracted diabetes diagnosis data from NIH web database including Glucose level, Body Mass Index, Age, Blood Pressure,
Skin Thickness, Insulin, and Diabetes Pedigree Function.
* Processed data cleaning through feature engineering and explored correlation matrix to identify the multicollinearity of the
features; utilized the K-means clustering algorithm to identify the inherent structure and pattern of data.
* Developed predictive models with linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, decision tree and k-fold cross-validations.
* Compared each model with the baseline linear model by evaluating accuracy through confusion matrix and improved the prediction power to 90.3% recall.
